# choco-light XFCE4 Notification Theme

![choco-light Notification Preview](https://github.com/ozd64/choco-light-xfce-notification-theme/blob/main/choco-light-preview.png?raw=true)

##### Simple, elegant light notification design targeting XFCE4 platforms.

## Installation
Installing the choco-light theme is fairly simple. Copying the `choco-light` folder into your `/usr/share/themes` folder should enable the theme for your XFCE system. (Please note that you will be asked to provide sudo permissions) Besides, copying the `choco-light` folder into your `~/.local/share/themes` should also work.

***Arch Linux AUR package will be provided in the future***

## Contributing and Reporting
Contributions are always welcome! I'm personally not good at CSS though. That is, I might have made some mistakes with making the notification theme. Please feel free to approach in the case of theme issues.
